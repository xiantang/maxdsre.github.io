      <description>The value of a person lies in finding connections between memorized information.
 I previously recommended bidirectional link software to my friends for rote memorization, and many people asked me &amp;ldquo;Why use bidirectional links? What are the benefits?&amp;rdquo;. I will write a short article here to answer these questions.
