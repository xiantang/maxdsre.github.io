      <description>Docker is not a new technology, but a tool that puts old wine in new bottles.
 Actually, I used Docker when I was in college, around 2017, when Docker was in its heyday. It was just used to start various lightweight applications, such as magnetic link downloaders, personal network disks, etc. Until recently, my understanding of Docker was still relatively vague. As I continued to encounter requirements at work, I also continued to understand Docker, so I decided to write an article to summarize my recent use of Docker.</description>
