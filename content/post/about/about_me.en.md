## About me

Welcome! I am Xiantang. This is my personal website, where I blog about things I learn or think about in my daily life. I hope you like it.

My personal telegram channel is <https://t.me/xiantang>.

I like programming and can use many languages, such as:

Golang <https://github.com/cosmtrek/air> is my main language currently.

Scala <https://github.com/xiantang/redislimiter> I have written some services.

Python <https://github.com/xiantang/Spider> I have written some crawlers.

Java <https://github.com/xiantang/JerryMouse> I have written a simple web container.

I also like using vim, but I use it on the Jetbrain platform with a [vim plugin](https://github.com/xiantang/dotfile/blob/main/.ideavimrc).

I am currently working in Singapore and I like [open source](https://github.com/xiantang) and investing.

I prefer long-termism, constantly blogging, open sourcing, and investing are my outputs for long-termism. I will continue to pave the way for the future in this way.
