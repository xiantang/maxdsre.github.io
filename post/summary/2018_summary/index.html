      <p>It&rsquo;s the end of the year, so I&rsquo;m going to write a little summary of 2018.</p>
<p>This year, there have been losses and gains. The loss was the failure of a relationship that didn&rsquo;t work out, and the gain was a general improvement in my personal quality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not dwell on what&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the gains.</p>
<p>The gains can be divided into three aspects: physical, technical, and financial.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about the physical aspect. At the beginning of this year, when I was just starting my second year of college, I insisted on going to the playground to run a few laps every day. Sometimes, even when it was raining, we would still go for a run. But eventually, I was the only one left, so I gave up. After that, I didn&rsquo;t exercise much, staying in the lab until 10 o&rsquo;clock every day, and I felt a bit dull. Then came the internship. I tried going to the gym for a day during the internship, but it was too far from where I lived, so I gave up. <del>Actually, it was because I was too lazy</del> But deep down, I still wanted to go to the gym and keep exercising. So, in October of this semester, I got a gym membership. At first, I was working out alone, and sometimes there were unqualified personal trainers trying to trick me into signing up for their courses, but I always refused with the excuse of being poor. However, I wasn&rsquo;t really serious about working out. Then, in mid-October, Tao (a teammate from the lab) started training with me. That&rsquo;s when I realized what real fitness is. Every time I saw Tao&rsquo;s grimacing face, I thought I should try harder. I kept it up until the end of the year, and I feel that my shoulders have become a bit stronger, my arms a bit thicker, and I no longer feel weak from sitting too long. Although I&rsquo;ve made a little progress, I know that fitness is a long-term commitment, and muscles need to be sculpted slowly.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about technology. The biggest change this year was the switch from Python to Java as my main development language. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to make this change, as I felt that the future of web scraping and Python backend was uncertain. I mainly wanted to focus on web scraping, but gradually felt that it would be better as a secondary skill. I went through a lot of indecision, but eventually made the decision. As for Java, I don&rsquo;t really dislike it. It&rsquo;s a very good and stable language with a great ecosystem. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I can&rsquo;t fully master Python. As for learning Java, I&rsquo;m still very unfamiliar with this vast language. I hope I can start from the basics and gradually understand the architecture of the backend. I want to tell my future self that backend is not just about Java, a good backend engineer won&rsquo;t be limited by language.</p>
<p>As for money, my understanding this year is that as long as it&rsquo;s enough, it&rsquo;s fine. At the beginning of the year, due to some changes, I quit my part-time job as a stock clerk, so my income was a bit less than before. But after the semester started, I began to take on web scraping outsourcing projects. I didn&rsquo;t work very hard on them, but they just offset the salary I used to earn as a stock clerk. However, that period was very beneficial for my technical growth, as it made me more familiar with Python. During my web scraping internship this year, I worked for two months during the summer vacation and earned 6K. Sadly, most of this 6K was offset by my expenses in Hangzhou, which was a bit harsh. But after returning to school, I got a new phone, which should last me for the remaining two years. Recently, the project leader from my previous company asked me to do some web scraping. I asked for a high price <del>because I didn&rsquo;t really want to do it</del>. I tried it and found that the workload was much larger than I expected, so I gave up. As I said at the beginning, as long as it&rsquo;s enough, it&rsquo;s fine. Being able to learn the technology I like and work on the projects I want to do is a very happy thing. If you keep doing what you love, good things will come.</p>
<p>My 2018 was like this, I won&rsquo;t write out my goals for 2019 yet, I just hope to become a better version of myself.</p>
